# Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
Project for the Cognitive Computing and Artificial Intelligence course of the LM-32 Master's Degree course, University of Catania, A.A. 2021/2022.

Project developed by **Daniele Amenta** and **Daniele D'Agosta**.

# File structuring
The file __*Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model.ipynb*__ contains the code to train the model. The code requires write access to Google Drive.
The files __*IS.ipynb*__ and __*FID.ipynb*__ contain the code to calculate the output metrics obtained as a result of training the model.

Then, the file __*Presentation - DDPM.pptx*__ contains the compact presentation of the content of the project and the operations carried out by us. finally, the file __*Paper - DDPM.pptx*__ contains the paper that was used as a reference for the development of the project.
